## Final Project - DESIGN 

### About the project: 

This project was divided into three different sections that are now implemented: 
UI, Audio, Programming

The first part of the project consisted in thinking about the appropiate way of showing this idea to people. I created some sketches of the basic functionality and the general aesthetics of the application https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IWlBeYf93YzEmyiikBlIx8la8hRwGB_Z
It had to include all of the keys with their corresponding color, so that users start making the association.

It terms of Audio, I recorded all of the samples using Ableton Live and Logic Pro X. They came from Alchemy and Wavetable. Then they were processed with a little bit of reverb and imported into XCode.



## Scriabin consists of a drawing tool that incorporates keys to make a simple composition, both visually and musically. The initial idea was to have twelve keys, each with its corresponding color according to Scriabinâ€™s circle of fifths. For this project, one key (D) is working as a proof of concept. 

##The main menu --- Once the key is selected, the program uses navigation controller to enter the new screen. This new screen has the specific background color corresponding to the key; for example, D is yellow. The user can choose the width of the brush and its color, with the pentatonic scale as the basis.
